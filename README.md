Project 1-Classification_Insurance_Claim is a GitHub repository that contains the code and resources for a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the likelihood of an insurance claim being made.
The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a claim will be made or not.
The code is written in Python and uses various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
The final model selected for this project is a decision tree, which was found to have the highest accuracy and performed well in both training and testing.
